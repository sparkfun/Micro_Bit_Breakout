[*Micro Bit Breakout (BOB-13988)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13988)

The [Micro Bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13988) is a board that connects to the BBC micro:bit and breaks out all 21 GPIO pins, power, and ground to a 0.1" header. It expands the capabilities of the micro:bit by providing access to more pins and allowing for connections to the I2C and SPI buses.



The [SparkFun Battery Babysitter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13988) is an all-in-one single-cell lithium polymer (LiPo) battery manager. It’s half **battery-charger**, half **battery monitor**, and it’s all you’ll ever need to keep your battery-powered project running safely and extensively.

More information can be found in the [Micro Bit Breakout Hookup Guide](%%%LINK%%%).
