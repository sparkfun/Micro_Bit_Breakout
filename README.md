[*Micro Bit Breakout (BOB-13988)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13988)

The [Micro Bit Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13988) is a board that connects to the BBC micro:bit and breaks out all 21 GPIO pins, power, and ground to a 0.1" header. It expands the capabilities of the micro:bit by providing access to more pins and allowing for connections to the I2C and SPI buses.

The micro:bit Breakout Board is also [available with pre-soldered headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13989). More information can be found in the [Micro Bit Breakout Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/microbit-breakout-board-hookup-guide).
